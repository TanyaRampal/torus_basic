WARNING (XSTRM-20): Output Stream file '/home/t3rampal/ece720t7-f24/labs/t3rampal-lab2/drc/low_swing_tx.calibre.db' already exists. It will be overwritten.
INFO (XSTRM-217): Reading the layer map file, /CMC/tsmc_65nm/CRN65GP/TN65CMSP018K3_V1.0C/tsmcN65/tsmcN65.layermap
INFO (XSTRM-162): You have not used the viaMap option. If the OpenAccess design has native oaVia instances, use the -viaMap option for preserving oaVia instances in a Stream Out - Stream In round trip. Using the -viaMap option improves performance and VM usage of applications using the Streamed-In design.  For details on the viaMap option, refer to the "Design Data Translator's Reference" guide for XStream.

INFO (XSTRM-180): You have not used the objectMap option. The design has instance(s) of at least one of following OpenAccess objects: oaBlockage, oaBoundary, oaRow, and oaMarker. Any information about these objects will not be translated into the generated stream file. Use the objectMap option to translate/preserve these objects using XStream. For details on the objectMap option, refer to the "Design Data Translator's Reference" guide for XStream.
